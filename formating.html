  <p>The purpose of <del>lorem ipsum</del> is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) <strong>that doesn't distract </strong>from the layout. A practice not without <ins>controversy</ins>, laying out pages with <b>meaningless</b> <B>filler</B> text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.

The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960<sup>s</sup> when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90<sub>s</sub> as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. <mark>Today it's seen all around the web</mark>; on templates, websites, and stock designs.
